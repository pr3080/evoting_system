Abstract
The Online Voting system is designed for citizens of the country who live all over the world and 
want to vote for their representative. The election can be held in two ways: with paper ballots or 
with electronic ballots. Electronic voting refers to automated ballot elections. The online voting 
system is well developed, and the online polling system can be substituted by voting properly 
and directly online, with immediate results. Because the online voting system is powered by the 
internet, it is also known as Internet Voting.
The Electronic Ballot Marker makes it easier for voters to vote by displaying voting options on 
the display of the electronic machine. The direct recording electronic voting machine is one that 
has a display that can be activated when the voter touches it. It has mechanical and electro 
optical buttons, software that accepts the vote, and an image or symbol on the display.
Electronic ballots are linked to central ballot systems, which accept and receive an updated 
record of all ballots. The Precinct count method is used by the central ballot system to calculate 
all votes from ballots present at polling centers. The outcomes are immediate.
